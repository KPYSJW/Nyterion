English Instructions for AI
Here are the instructions you can provide to the AI in English:

For C# code style:

"Please avoid using the var keyword in C# code. Use explicit type declarations instead."
Or more simply: "Don't use var in C#."
For language preference:

"Please use Korean when providing explanations or additional information."
Or: "Explain things to me in Korean."
You can combine these into a single instruction, for example:

"When generating C# code, please avoid using the var keyword and use explicit type declarations. Also, please use Korean for any explanations or additional information you provide."
